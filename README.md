- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DeandreJJ2323
- ðŸ˜ƒ Iâ€™m interested in sports, coding, and spending time with family.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning front end technologies such as Javascript, HTML, & CSS. I mostly stay on the backend side of things when it comes to application developing, but as time wanes I expect to add more skills to my arsenal.
- ðŸŒ‰ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on just about anything really! Im hoping I can use github as bridge to connect me with fellow developers alike !
